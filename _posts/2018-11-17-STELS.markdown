Description
==============

We introduce a mixed reality game that puts you in shoes of an elite soldier / agent. As a part of your training you will compete against other players in “Battle Royal” mode. But the catch is that the play area is the streets of your city. Just launch our app and the game begins!

Navigation
----------
As you wonder the streets of
the city with our app running,
you will get notifications of the
encounters happenning
nearby.

If you decide to join the encounter, you will get directions
on how to get to the place
where its happening.
When you are there wait for
other players to gather and
the game will start.

Gameplay
--------
In the progress of the game
your goal will be to find and
neutrazlie all other players.
You will get approximate
player locations and their up
to date photos. But you won’t
know which location corresponds to which player. So you will have to carefully approach the target. Select them in an app and press neutralize when you are in 5 meters or closer to them.

Development
-----

Right now the application is implemented only for Android platform and its fea tures are limited. Our future development plans include UI improvements in the
gameplay section, user profile creation, ranking and matchmaking systems.

The game was developed by Innopolis University students as a part of HCI course.

Description
==============

This prototype shows possible implementation of Lego Tower Defense game in mixed reality. It was developed in 4 weeks during an internship at Cologne Game Lab. The main idea was to test how players would interact with the level in the real world.

Lego Tower Defence is a mixed reality game where players will be able to construct the level and to place towers in the real world, while the actual battle will be happening on the screen.
